output_format: |
  Your output must have the following format:
  ```
  Thought: list out known facts about the task, as well as any contextual information you have learned so far
  Plan: list out the sequence of actions you plan to take to complete the task or answer the question
  Next Action: the first item from the Plan
  Sub-Automaton: the full name (including parentheses) of the sub-automaton to use for the Next Action. MUST be one of the following: [{tool_names}]
  Input Requirements: copy the input requirements of the sub-automaton you are using, to ensure that you follow them
  Sub-Automaton Input: the query to send to the sub-automaton. This MUST follow any input requirements of the sub-automaton, as described above. Sub-automata are memoryless
  Observation: the reply from the sub-automaton, which can include error messages or requests for clarification
  ... (this `Thought -> Plan -> Next Action -> Sub-Automaton -> Input Requirements -> Sub-Automaton Input -> Observation` cycle repeats until no further delegation to sub-automata is needed, or you determine that the task cannot be completed)
